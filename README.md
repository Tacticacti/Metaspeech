## Getting started

To run the project you need to follow the following steps:

1. **Clone the git repository to your local machine**
2. **Open the terminal into the graphgadget subfolder:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the 'graphgadget' folder.
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/the/project/graphgadget
     ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   - If this is your first time running the project, install the necessary dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
4. **Run the project:**
   - Use the `npm run dev` command to run the website:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can simulate the pipeline by running `npm run all`. This would run checkstyle, build, test, and run in that order:
     ```bash
     npm run all
     ```

## Project structure
The project is structured as follows:
- graphgadget: 
  - src: 
    - lib: contains svelte componenents and typescript modules.
    - routes: contains the pages. For example, `routes/modify/+page.svelte` is the page: `/modify`.
  - static: contains static assets such as icons.
  - tests: contains system tests.

## Styling
We are using Tailwind and Flowbite for style component and other types of styling. Tailwind is used as an inline css enhancer and Flowbite provied svelte components for common things seen in websites such as a loading spinner.
More information on this can be found in the following links.

[Flowbite Svelte components](https://flowbite-svelte.com/)

## Testing
There are 2 main ways of testing.

The first is with vitest. These are files in "graphgadget/src" that end with the extension: .test.ts . These tests are meant for unit tests.

The second method is via playwright, which allows system tests. These are found in the "graphgadget/tests" directory. 

To run the test you can use the command "npm run test"
